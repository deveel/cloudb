# Network configuration
# =====================

# A comma separated list of IP addresses of all machines in
# the network that are permitted to connect to the node. A
# node will reject any connections from IP addresses not in
# this whitelist.
#
# This list must contain the list of all IP addresses that
# are allowed to connect to the network instance.
#
# If this property is '*' then connections are accepted from
# all sources (not recommended in public networks).
#
# Usage example;
#
#  connect_whitelist=127.0.0.1,\
#     192.168.12.10, 192.168.12.11,\
#     192.168.12.12, 192.168.12.15,\
#     192.168.13.100
#
# In this demonstration;
# Only allow localhost connections to this node.

connect_whitelist=127.0.0.1


# A comma separated list of machine nodes on the network.
# Each entry is formatted as [address]:[port]. This list
# is used for network discovery.
#
# Usage example;
#
#  network_nodelist=\
#     192.168.12.10:3500, 192.168.12.11:3500,\
#     http://db1.example.com:3600, localhost:3500
#
# In this demonstration;
# We are running 1 node on port 3500 of localhost.

network_nodelist=127.0.0.1:3500
